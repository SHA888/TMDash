# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Secure Data Handling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures for patient data storage, transmission, and access control.
# Details:
1. Implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmission
2. Utilize MoonBit's type system for data validation and integrity checks
3. Create role-based access control system for patient data
4. Implement detailed audit logging of all data access and modifications
5. Develop secure data export and sharing options for patient records
6. Implement automatic session timeouts and multi-factor authentication
7. Create data anonymization for research and analytics purposes
8. Implement secure backup and recovery procedures
9. Develop compliance reporting for HIPAA and other regulations
10. Create data retention and purging policies in line with regulations

# Test Strategy:
1. Security penetration testing
2. Encryption validation tests
3. Access control testing for each role
4. Audit log verification
5. Compliance testing against HIPAA requirements
6. Data integrity validation tests
7. Recovery testing from backup
8. Performance testing of encrypted operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement End-to-End Encryption System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a robust encryption system for data at rest and in transit
### Details:
Develop encryption protocols using industry standards (AES-256, RSA-2048), implement key management system, create secure key rotation policies, ensure encrypted data storage, and establish TLS/SSL for all data transmissions. Include encryption performance testing and documentation.

## 2. Develop Role-Based Access Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive access control system with fine-grained permissions
### Details:
Design role hierarchy, implement permission matrices, create user authentication with MFA, develop session management, build administrative interfaces for role assignment, and ensure integration with encryption systems. Include automated access review mechanisms.

## 3. Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a tamper-proof audit logging system that captures all data access and modifications
### Details:
Develop centralized logging infrastructure, implement detailed event capture (user, timestamp, action, data affected), ensure log integrity with cryptographic validation, create log rotation and archival policies, and build real-time alerting for suspicious activities.

## 4. Develop Data Anonymization Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create systems to anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data for processing and reporting
### Details:
Implement data classification system, develop algorithms for data masking and tokenization, create reversible pseudonymization for authorized users, build configuration tools for anonymization rules, and ensure anonymization effectiveness testing.

## 5. Build HIPAA Compliance Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Develop automated compliance reporting and documentation system
### Details:
Create compliance dashboard with real-time status, implement automated report generation for audits, develop breach notification workflows, maintain documentation of security controls, and build tools for risk assessment and gap analysis against HIPAA requirements.
