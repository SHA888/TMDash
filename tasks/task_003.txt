# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Authentication and Authorization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure, HIPAA-compliant authentication and authorization system with role-based access control.
# Details:
1. Implement user registration and login functionality
2. Create secure password hashing and storage using industry-standard algorithms
3. Develop JWT-based authentication system
4. Implement role-based access control with the following roles:
   - Patient
   - Healthcare Provider
   - Clinic Administrator
   - System Administrator
5. Create permission sets for each role
6. Implement multi-factor authentication
7. Set up secure session management with automatic timeouts
8. Create audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
9. Implement account recovery and password reset functionality
10. Design and implement API authentication middleware

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication logic
2. Integration tests for login/logout flows
3. Security testing for password policies
4. Authorization tests for each role and permission
5. Penetration testing for authentication endpoints
6. Test MFA functionality
7. Verify audit logging accuracy
8. Test session timeout and renewal

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Registration and Profile Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a secure user registration system with email verification and profile management capabilities
### Details:
Develop user registration endpoints with input validation, email verification workflow, secure storage of user profiles, password strength requirements, and account recovery mechanisms. Ensure all personal information is stored in compliance with HIPAA requirements.

## 2. Implement Secure Password Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop password hashing, storage, and reset functionality with industry-standard security practices
### Details:
Implement password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2, secure password reset workflows with time-limited tokens, password history tracking to prevent reuse, and account lockout mechanisms after failed attempts. Document all security measures for compliance reviews.

## 3. Implement JWT Authentication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create a JWT-based authentication system with proper token management
### Details:
Develop JWT token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms. Implement secure token storage, proper expiration policies, token revocation capabilities, and protection against common JWT attacks. Ensure tokens contain appropriate claims for authorization purposes.

## 4. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive RBAC system for the healthcare application
### Details:
Create role definitions (admin, healthcare provider, patient, etc.), permission sets, role assignment mechanisms, and middleware for enforcing access controls across all API endpoints. Implement hierarchical permission inheritance and document the complete RBAC structure.

## 5. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add MFA capabilities to enhance security for sensitive operations
### Details:
Integrate TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authentication, SMS verification options, email verification codes, and recovery mechanisms. Implement MFA enrollment workflows, device management, and appropriate bypass mechanisms for account recovery.

## 6. Implement Security Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Create comprehensive audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
### Details:
Develop a system to log all security-relevant events including login attempts, permission changes, security setting modifications, and sensitive data access. Ensure logs are tamper-proof, properly structured for analysis, and compliant with HIPAA audit requirements. Implement log rotation and retention policies.
