# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Cross-Platform Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the platform works consistently across different devices and browsers through responsive design and WebAssembly optimization.
# Details:
1. Optimize WebAssembly compilation for performance across browsers
2. Implement responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
3. Create device-specific optimizations for mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. Develop offline capabilities for certain functionality using Service Workers
5. Implement progressive enhancement for varying browser capabilities
6. Create adaptive UI components that respond to screen size and orientation
7. Optimize network usage for varying connection qualities
8. Implement touch-friendly interfaces for mobile devices
9. Create consistent keyboard navigation and shortcuts
10. Develop and test print stylesheets for reports and summaries

# Test Strategy:
1. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Mobile device testing on iOS and Android
3. Responsive design testing across breakpoints
4. Performance testing on low-end devices
5. Offline functionality testing
6. Accessibility testing across platforms
7. Load time testing on various connection speeds
8. User testing with different device types

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement WebAssembly optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize the application for WebAssembly to ensure consistent performance across browsers and platforms
### Details:
Identify performance-critical components suitable for WebAssembly, compile C/C++ code to WebAssembly modules, implement JavaScript bindings for WebAssembly modules, and benchmark performance improvements across different browsers and devices

## 2. Develop responsive design framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive responsive design system that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
### Details:
Implement fluid grid layouts, flexible images and media, CSS media queries for breakpoints, touch-friendly UI elements, and test across various device dimensions and resolutions

## 3. Implement offline capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop offline functionality to ensure the application remains usable without an internet connection
### Details:
Implement Service Workers for caching assets and API responses, develop an offline-first data strategy with IndexedDB, create synchronization mechanisms for when connectivity is restored, and implement clear UI indicators for offline mode

## 4. Create device-specific adaptations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop and implement adaptations for specific device capabilities and limitations
### Details:
Implement feature detection for device capabilities, create fallback mechanisms for unsupported features, optimize for touch vs. mouse input, adapt to different hardware performance levels, and test on a representative range of devices including mobile, tablet, desktop, and various operating systems
