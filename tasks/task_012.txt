# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement System Optimization and Scaling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize performance, implement caching strategies, and prepare the system for scaling.
# Details:
1. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. Optimize database queries and indexing
3. Set up CDN for global content delivery
4. Implement load balancing for high availability
5. Create auto-scaling configuration for cloud infrastructure
6. Develop performance monitoring and alerting
7. Implement database sharding strategy for horizontal scaling
8. Optimize WebAssembly code size and execution speed
9. Create disaster recovery procedures and testing
10. Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

# Test Strategy:
1. Load testing under various traffic conditions
2. Performance benchmarking before and after optimizations
3. Stress testing to identify breaking points
4. Failover testing for high availability
5. Recovery testing from simulated failures
6. Latency testing across geographic regions
7. Long-running stability tests
8. Resource utilization monitoring during peak loads

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Multi-level Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive caching solution to reduce database load and improve response times
### Details:
Analyze current system bottlenecks, implement Redis/Memcached for application-level caching, set up CDN for static assets, implement browser caching policies, define cache invalidation strategies, and document cache hit/miss metrics

## 2. Optimize Database Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Improve database efficiency through query optimization, indexing, and potential sharding strategies
### Details:
Analyze slow queries using performance tools, implement proper indexing, optimize query patterns, consider read replicas for heavy read operations, implement connection pooling, evaluate potential for database sharding, and document performance improvements

## 3. Configure Load Balancing Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Set up robust load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across application servers
### Details:
Select appropriate load balancing algorithm (round-robin, least connections, etc.), implement health checks, configure SSL termination, set up sticky sessions if needed, implement rate limiting, and document the load balancing architecture

## 4. Implement Auto-scaling Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Create auto-scaling rules and infrastructure to handle variable load conditions
### Details:
Define scaling metrics (CPU, memory, request rate), set up scaling policies with appropriate thresholds, implement pre-warming strategies for predictable traffic spikes, ensure proper instance provisioning and deprovisioning, test scaling behavior, and document the auto-scaling configuration

## 5. Deploy Comprehensive Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Implement monitoring and alerting systems to track system performance and identify issues proactively
### Details:
Set up APM tools (New Relic, Datadog, etc.), implement custom metrics for business-critical paths, create dashboards for key performance indicators, configure alerting thresholds, implement log aggregation, set up synthetic monitoring for critical user journeys, and document the monitoring strategy
