# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Real-Time Communication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the WebRTC-based video consultation and real-time chat functionality for telemedicine sessions.
# Details:
1. Integrate WebRTC technology through JavaScript interop for peer-to-peer video streaming
2. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time text chat functionality
3. Create screen sharing and file transfer capabilities during consultations
4. Develop waiting room functionality with provider availability status
5. Implement adaptive video quality based on available bandwidth
6. Create recording functionality for consultations (with appropriate consent)
7. Implement end-to-end encryption for all communications
8. Build fallback mechanisms for poor connectivity scenarios
9. Create UI components for video controls (mute, camera toggle, etc.)
10. Implement session persistence and recovery for dropped connections

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for WebRTC and WebSocket implementations
2. Integration tests for video and chat functionality
3. Performance testing under various network conditions
4. Security testing for end-to-end encryption
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing
6. Mobile device testing
7. Load testing with multiple concurrent sessions
8. Usability testing with provider and patient personas

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up WebRTC peer connection infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core WebRTC peer connection handling for video/audio streaming
### Details:
Create the foundation for WebRTC connections including: implementing SDP offer/answer exchange, ICE candidate gathering and exchange, configuring STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal, and establishing the basic media stream handling for camera and microphone access. Include proper error handling for permission denials and device unavailability.

## 2. Integrate WebSocket signaling server [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the WebSocket-based signaling mechanism for WebRTC connection establishment
### Details:
Create a WebSocket server to handle signaling between peers, including: user authentication and session management, room creation and joining logic, SDP and ICE candidate exchange, and connection state notifications. Implement heartbeat mechanism to detect disconnections and handle reconnection attempts.

## 3. Implement screen sharing functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Add the ability for users to share their screen during consultation
### Details:
Extend the WebRTC implementation to support screen sharing by: adding getDisplayMedia API integration, implementing UI controls for starting/stopping screen sharing, handling screen sharing permissions across browsers, and managing the transition between camera and screen sharing streams.

## 4. Develop waiting room functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a virtual waiting room system for managing consultation queues
### Details:
Build a waiting room system that: maintains a queue of waiting participants, notifies hosts when someone is waiting, allows hosts to admit participants from the waiting room, displays estimated wait times, and provides a notification system for status updates to waiting users.

## 5. Implement end-to-end encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Add encryption to ensure secure communication between participants
### Details:
Implement end-to-end encryption for the WebRTC streams by: researching and selecting appropriate encryption algorithms compatible with WebRTC, implementing key exchange mechanisms, ensuring encryption works across different browsers and devices, and adding visual indicators of encryption status for users.

## 6. Create fallback mechanisms for poor connectivity [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.5
### Description: Develop adaptive quality and fallback options for unstable connections
### Details:
Implement fallback strategies including: adaptive bitrate and resolution based on connection quality, audio-only mode for very poor connections, implementing bandwidth estimation, creating a reconnection mechanism with session persistence, and developing a text-chat fallback option when video/audio fails completely.
